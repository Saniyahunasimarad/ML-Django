Magic Gamma Telescope Classification & RegressionThis project utilizes the Magic Gamma Telescope Dataset to perform classification and regression tasks using various machine learning algorithms. The primary goal is to classify high-energy gamma particles and hadron particles based on their physical characteristics.Dataset InformationThe dataset used is magic04.data, which contains 19,020 observations with 11 total columns. The features represent different measurements of the particles:Features: fLength, fWidth, fSize, fConc, fConc1, fAsym, fM3Long, fM3Trans, fAlpha, fDist.Target Variable: class (Classifies particles into gamma or hadron).Project WorkflowData Cleaning: Importing the dataset and assigning appropriate column names.Exploratory Data Analysis: Examining the unique values and structure of the data.Model Training: Implementing and comparing various classification models.Regression Analysis: Performing linear regression to find correlations between specific features.Model Performance SummaryClassification TaskThe following models were trained and evaluated based on their accuracy and weighted F1-Score:ModelAccuracyF1-Score (Weighted)NotesNeural Network0.880.88Best performing model after hyperparameter tuning.Support Vector Machine (SVM)0.860.86Strongest traditional machine learning model.K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)0.810.81Sensitive to $k$ and distance metrics.Logistic Regression0.790.79Good baseline model.Naive Bayes (GaussianNB)0.720.70Fast training but limited by independence assumptions.Regression TaskA Simple Linear Regression was performed to predict fSize using fLength as the independent variable:Metric: R² ScoreValue: 0.4930Result: Indicated a moderate correlation between the length and size of the particles.ConclusionThe Neural Network is the most effective model for classifying gamma and hadron particles in this dataset. Traditional models like SVM also provide high accuracy for this task.RequirementsPython 3pandasscikit-learnTensorFlow/Keras (for the Neural Network)
